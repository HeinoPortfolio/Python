# Simple Unit Test 

- This is a simple example of a unit test as implemented in Python. It basically checks to see if a series of temperature conversions ge the the expected value.
- I have included tests for the raise exception that is required in the assignent. It is displayed as the first item in the output. I solved the problem with converting the units by looking at it as a generic function composed of a series of variables in the form: [value + a] * b + c. Where value is the unit to be converted and the rest are variables that take on a value whether or not they are pertinent to that particular equation. So by substituting the appropriate values you can "turn on" or "turn off" different parts of the equation.
