# Python Basics

## Book
*  Sets up a simple class that models a simple book attributes.  It allows for only one method to display the data elements of the Book class.

## isDivisible 
*  Checks to see if any numbers are divisible by the suppplied number.  If no number is given the default value is 2.

## Simple Unit Test
 * This is a simple example of a unit test as implemented in Python.  It basically checks to see if a series of temperature conversions ge the the expected value.
 * I have included tests for the raise exception that is required in the assignent. It is displayed as the first item in the output. I solved the problem with converting the units by looking at it as a generic function composed of a series of variables in the form: [value + a] * b + c. Where value is the unit to be converted and the rest are variables that take on a value whether or not they are pertinent to that particular equation. So by substituting the appropriate values you can "turn on" or "turn off" different parts of the equation.


## Pig
* This is a simple game that asks the user to keep rolling the dice until a desired number is reached.  There are a a few things that could be added but the concept is sound. A better check on the number of points after each save could be implemented, but that is not that big of a deal. This file makes use of command line argument passing to set up the number of players for the game.
