# Student Quiz Flask Example



The command to run the app is the following:

python student.py

I did not see a file name given in the assignment unless I looked over it. But all parts should work including the optional ones. The only thing that may be different would be if I took a different viewon how what the task was to do.  The application does work and so does the optional.  I do not foresee any problems running the program.  I have run it in Spyder and through the console and have had no problems.
Please let me know if you have any problems.
