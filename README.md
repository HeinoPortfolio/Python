<p>
This README file shows the general structure of the PYTHON Folder.

**NOTE:  Some of the files that are contained in this repository were created in two different releases of Python.  Some were created in Python 2.X and others were created in Python 3.X.  These files were taken from coursework from my time in college.  It did not pay to convert them.  They are here to prove concepts and as a review.**
