1. **Chess (Alternative_Project-master)** - In this project we were required to generate a CSV file and Jupyter Notebook that contains the following  Player's Name, Player's State, Total Number of Points, Player's Pre-Rating, and Average Pre Tournament Chess Rating.  One additional requirement is to calculate the average opponent rating for each opponent faced for each of the players in the table
