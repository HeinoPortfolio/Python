If you have a problem accessing the Noterbook through github. You can access the notebook through the following viewer:

If the above link does not work please try the following:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"

and copy this address into the text area:

https://github.com/meheino77/IS362WEEK_5/blob/master/IS362Assignment5.ipynb

It should work perfectically fine when viewed in this manner.

Please note that the viewer may load an older version of a notebook.  There is a corrected version uploaded to GithUb.  The revision corrects the the wrong date used to find windiest.  For some reason the nbviewer is loading the older version of the notebook and not the corrected version.
