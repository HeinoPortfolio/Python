# Music-
In this folder you will find a simple project that creates and reads from an MySQL database. This was an assignment that was given to me while I was a student. The database contains information about music and customers who bought it.  There is a Jupyter notebook that is used to display the information that was required for the assignment.

The folder structure is the following:
1. **Chinook_MySql.sql** - script to create the database.  This was not created by me but was downloadded based on the assignment requirement.
2. **IS362 Project 3 .ipynb** -  The notebook to view the assignment
3. **Project3.py** - A workup of the Python needed to complete the assignment.  This was done using Spyder.
4. **jupyter.csv** - The output CSV that was required as part of the assignment.
5. **testMusic.sql** - Query to join the required infromation,
