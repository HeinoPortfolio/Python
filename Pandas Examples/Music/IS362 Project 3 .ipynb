    "## Requirements for the Project\n",
    "The requirements for the project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Download and install the appropriate version of the Chinook database.\n",
    "2.  Create a pandas DataFrame that displays Customer's Last Name and First Name, and each customer's Track Names, and Album Titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the database\n",
    "\n",
    "THe database was created using the script that was provided in the repository that was presented above.  This database was created in MySQL utilizing the MYSQL Workbench.  This scripe created eleven tables.  These tables were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Album\n",
    "2. Artist\n",
    "3. Customer\n",
    "4. Employee\n",
    "5. Genre\n",
    "6. Invoice\n",
    "7. InvoiceLine\n",
    "8. MediaType\n",
    "9. PlayList\n",
    "10. playlistTrack\n",
    "11. Track\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joining the tables \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to retrieve the information that we need to get the required frame we need to join five tables. These tables are Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track and Album.  Each one of these tables have keys that found in the other.  This will allow us to join or link these tables to eachother.  The SQL query that we used to create the join was accomplished by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT customer.LastName, customer.FirstName, track.Name , album.Title\n",
    "FROM Customer\n",
    "JOIN invoice ON customer.CustomerId = invoice.CustomerId\n",
    "JOIN invoiceline ON invoice.InvoiceId = invoiceline.InvoiceId\n",
    "JOIN track ON invoiceline.TrackId = track.TrackId\n",
    "JOIN album ON track.AlbumId = album.AlbumId\n",
    "ORDER BY customer.LastName;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query was first tested in MySQL Workbench to make sure that query worked and it provided the right result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python code to query the data base\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step was to create a python script that connected to the database and issue the previous SQL query to retrieve the information from the database.  The code that was implemented was the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mport pandas as pd\n",
    "from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n",

    "\n",
    "db_query = 'SELECT customer.LastName, customer.FirstName, track.Name , album.Title FROM Customer JOIN invoice ON customer.CustomerId = invoice.CustomerId JOIN invoiceline ON invoice.InvoiceId = invoiceline.InvoiceId JOIN track ON invoiceline.TrackId = track.TrackId JOIN album ON track.AlbumId = album.AlbumId ORDER BY customer.LastName;'\n",
    "db_connection = create_engine(connection_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "print (db_connection)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "music_frame = pd.read_sql_query(db_query, con=db_connection)\n",
    "\n",
    "music_frame.rename(columns={\"LastName\": \"Last Name\", \"FirstName\":\"First Name\"}, inplace=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(music_frame.head())\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The frame was created than output to a CSV that was called jupyter.csv.  The actual working script can be [here](https://github.com/meheino77/IS362Project3/blob/master/Project3.py)\n"

    "The dataframe does not match the one that was given in theassignment specification. THis is beacuse the insert functions do not contain the data that would yield it.  There were changes to the insert that change the values even though the query seems to be correct.  I checked this by looking at the inserts for a few of the albums listed and they do not have the right data for the given assignment output.  I am not sure if this intentional or I have downloaded the wrong dataset."
