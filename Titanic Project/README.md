# Titanic Project

This repository contains a project that was developed while in attendance at CUNY - SPS.  The requirements of the project were to use as many of the concepts that were developed in the class.  The class placed special emphasis on the displaying of data.  We also needed to some simple statistical analysis of the data and present this in a visual form.  We also needed to use an API to look for further information about some aspect of the Titanic passenger.

In this case I choose to use NY Time API.  I used this API to look for information bout the the youngest, oldest and another well known passenger on the Titanic.  The two individuals that were used in this project were
1) Miss. Elizabeth Gladys "Millvina" Dean
2) Mr. Algernon Henry Wilson Barkworth
3) John Jacob Astor

Mr. Astor was used to make sure that the API query was returning a result set as the previous did not return any informational articles from the NY Times API. 

The last part of project asked us to make a prediction.  I used class as a determinant of survival.  While it is well know that those who were in the first and second class were know to have the highest survival rate.  Is it possible to predict this with the given data.  In this project I thought I could pose the question and get something I could really check against.  While this does not truly make adequate use of the Python's libraries.  It is a good way to test the uses of said libraries.
